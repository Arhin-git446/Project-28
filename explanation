Explanation:
HTML Structure: The HTML contains a button that, when clicked, triggers the causeError function. It also includes a paragraph to display any error messages.

JavaScript:

The causeError function attempts to call an undefined function (someUndefinedFunction), which generates an error.
The try block contains the code that might throw an error.
The catch block captures the error and displays an error message in the paragraph with the ID errorMessage.
